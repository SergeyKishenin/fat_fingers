# Fat Fingers â€” the demo

This is a Sinatra app that gives a one-page demo of how Fat Fingers will handle different e-mails.

It simply gives users an input and lets them try an e-mail and see how it would resolve, if passed through Fat Fingers.

It's useful for finding edge cases and testing the regex in an intuitive way.

All you need to do to launch it is run `ruby demo.rb` to run it on your own machine, once you're in the `demo` directory.
